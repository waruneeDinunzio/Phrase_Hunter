# Project 4 OOP Game Show App
### techDegree unit 4 with Treehouse
This is my first game ever! This browser-based game call "Phrase Hunter". User interacts by click on screen keyboard or press the physical keyboard tries to guess the hidden phrase.\
On CSS file I cleated hover over on a start button and all on screen button to turn green. I added background color on banner, a shadow on all button and title to make them look more stand out.
Enjoy!
